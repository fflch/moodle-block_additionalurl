*****YES, IT WORKS NOW!!!*****

A ojs plugin that creates a additional URL for articles.

Example. The URL:

    https://www.revistas.usp.br/organicom/article/view/197779/188335

Could be accessed too accordingly with article language:

    https://www.revistas.usp.br/organicom/article/view/197779/object_pt_BR.pdf
    https://www.revistas.usp.br/organicom/article/view/197779/en.pdf
    https://www.revistas.usp.br/organicom/article/view/197779/es.pdf

Using:

    cd plugins/generic
    git clone git@github.com:fflch/ojs-block_additionalurl.git additionalurl


So far it is configured to work by adding only object_pt_BR at the end of the url.
